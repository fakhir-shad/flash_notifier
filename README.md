# FlashNotifier

If you are tired of integrating flash messages in your rails application over and over again then this gem is for you!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flash_notifier'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install flash_notifier

## Usage

### For Bootstrap Flash Messages
    
Add this helper method in your layout and make sure you have bootstrap installed!

    <%= build_bootstrap_flash %>
    
You can make the flash dismissible by passing following optional options to the above helper method

    <%= build_bootstrap_flash dismiss: true, timeout: 5000 %>
    
##### default timeout duration is 5000, ignore this option if you want to use default timeout duration

You can add your own wrapper class by passing following parameter

    <%= build_bootstrap_flash wrapper_class: 'my-flash-notification' %>
    
### For other two libraries follow following steps            

#### Step 1: Choose a Library Noty JS or Toastr JS

#### For Noty JS 3.1.4 ([Official Website](https://ned.im/noty/#/))

Import noty library in your application.js

    //= require noty_lib
    
Add noty stylesheet in your application.scss

    @import "noty";
    
#### For Toastr JS 2.1.4 ([Official Website](https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/))

Import noty library in your application.js

    //= require toastr_lib
    
Add noty stylesheet in your application.scss

    @import "toastr.min";
    
### Step 2
    
In your layout add this helper method

    <%= build_flash %>
    
### Optional Step 3: Pass options to helper method  

For Onscreen positioning of flash message pass param

    <%= build_flash placement: 'topRight' %>
    
To manage progress bar pass param

    <%= build_flash progress_bar: true %>
    
To set auto hide timeout pass param

     <%= build_flash timeout: 3500 %>
     
To set default theme pass param (Note this param works only for Noty JS)

     <%= build_flash theme: 'mint' %>
    
##### Values for these params can be found here [Noty JS](https://ned.im/noty/#/options), [Toastr JS](https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/demo.html)
